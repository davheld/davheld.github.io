<h2>Abstract</h2>
In order to track dynamic objects in a robot's environment, one must first segment the scene into a collection of separate objects. Most real-time robotic vision systems today rely on simple spatial relations to segment the scene into separate objects.  However, such methods fail under a variety of real-world situations such as occlusions or crowds of closely-packed objects.  We propose a probabilistic 3D segmentation method that combines spatial, temporal, and semantic information to make better-informed decisions about how to segment a scene. We begin with a coarse initial segmentation.  We then compute the probability that a given segment should be split into multiple segments or that multiple segments should be merged into a single segment, using spatial, semantic, and temporal cues. Our probabilistic segmentation framework enables us to significantly reduce both undersegmentations and oversegmentations on the KITTI dataset while still running in real-time. By combining spatial, temporal, and semantic information, we are able to create a more robust 3D segmentation system that leads to better overall perception in crowded dynamic environments.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
To help others who are attempting to evaluate their own segmentation methods and compare to our method, we recommend to read this document, which further clarifies our evaluation method: <a href="seg_eval.pdf">[Evaluation]</a> and download <a href="evaluation.zip">these files</a>, which contain the output of our method and some Matlab files to process them.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
Q: When computing the position probability (equation 10 in the <a href="http://davheld.github.io/segmentation3D/RSS_2016_Final_Version_28.pdf">original paper</a> or equation 21 in the <a href="http://davheld.github.io/segmentation3D/segmentation_extended.pdf">extended version</a>), what do you use for the mean and covariance of the velocity if the data association indicates that we are matching to two previous segments?
<br><br>
A: In this case, we currently have a heuristic of just using the velocity distribution from the larger of the two previous segments.  Of course, other approaches can be used here.
