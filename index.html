                             My latest research has been on modeling how the appearance of an object can change over time.  I have applied this idea to the problems of segmentation, tracking, velocity estimation, and object recognition for <a href="http://driving.stanford.edu/index.html">autonomous driving</a>, and I have shown how, by modeling these appearance changes, we can significantly improve a robot's perception capabilities.-->
                            <p>My research lies at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and computer vision.
                            </p>
                            <p>I am interested in developing methods for robotic perception and control that can allow robots to operate in the messy, cluttered environments of our daily lives.  My approach is to design new deep learning / machine learning algorithms to understand environmental changes: how dynamic objects in the environment can move and how to affect the environment to achieve a desired task.
                            </p>
                            <p>I have applied this idea of learning to understand environmental changes to
                            improve a robot's capabilities in two domains: object manipulation and autonomous driving.  I am currently working on
                            learning to control indoor robots for various object manipulation tasks, dealing with questions about multi-task learning, robust learning, simulation to real-world transfer, and safety. Within <a href="http://driving.stanford.edu/index.html">autonomous driving</a>, I have shown how, by modeling object
                            appearance changes, we can improve a robot's capabilities for every
                            part of the robot perception pipeline: segmentation, tracking,
                            velocity estimation, and object recognition.  By teaching
                            robots to understand and affect environmental changes, I hope to open the door
                            to many new robotics applications, such as robots for our homes, assisted living
                            facilities, schools, hospitals, or disaster relief areas.
